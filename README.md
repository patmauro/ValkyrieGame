# Ride of the USS Valkyrie
My first larger-scale Java project, created for an Intro Software Design and Implementation course in spring 2010. The object is to destroy a rapidly-approaching UFO in as little time as possible. Uses public-domain sfx &amp; music, and original art assets created in Adobe Fireworks. It was originally created in an IDE called DrJava and has been reconfigured as a NetBeans project.

I'm uploading it completely as-is, warts and all, which means I haven't tried to clean it up or update it at all. As such, my overall styling is sloppy, and my attempts at using JavaDoc formatting are haphazard and inconsistent, because it was one of my first real projects in Java (rest assured I know better now.) Also, since it's an older project, certain components have since become deprecated, so you may get the following errors but I'm not going to bother fixing it:

>"Warning: Unsigned and self-signed WebStart applications and Applets are deprecated from JDK7u21 onwards due to security reasons. To ensure future correct functionality please sign WebStart applications and Applets using trusted certificate."

>"WARNING: This application, or a library it uses, is using the deprecated Carbon Component Manager for hosting Audio Units. Support for this will be removed in a future release. Also, this makes the host incompatible with version 3 audio units. Please transition to the API's in AudioComponent.h."

>This program is an enhanced version of UFOWorld, rebuilt from the ground-up in a manner that implements acm.graphics and javax.swing. This version is called "Flight of the USS Valkyrie," features lots of graphics, extensive sound effects and music, and a scorekeeping method based on how long the user took to play a round. The highest possible score is 250, which would be awarded to the player if he or she finished a round in zero seconds. This is realistically impossible, but the challenge lies in getting as close to 250 as possible, through practice.
